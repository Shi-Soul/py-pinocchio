1. continue your remaining tasks. some important parts are not implemented
2. don't call your project `pinocchio` since there is an original package called this. instead name it as py-pinocchio

---
go on

---
1. check type annotation, ensure the  types are all right
2. write simple visualization of the robot 
3. write more test and examples. e.g. legged robot, arm with more dofs, and so on.
