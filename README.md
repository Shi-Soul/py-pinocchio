# py-pinocchio

A fast and flexible implementation of Rigid Body Dynamics algorithms and their analytical derivatives, designed for educational purposes.

All the codes and documents are generated by [Augment Code](www.augmentcode.com), all user request history are provided in `chat_history/`. **All content are not manually reviewed**.

## Features

- **Simple and Educational**: Clean, well-documented code designed for learning rigid body dynamics
- **Multiple Format Support**: Load robot models from URDF and MJCF files
- **Core Algorithms**: Forward/inverse kinematics, dynamics, and Jacobian computations
- **Pure Python**: Easy to understand implementation using NumPy
- **Extensible**: Modular design for easy extension and customization

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Shi-Soul/py-pinocchio.git
cd py-pinocchio

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Or install with development dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Quick Start

```python
import py_pinocchio as pin

# Load a robot model from URDF
robot = pin.parse_urdf_file("path/to/robot.urdf")

# Compute forward kinematics
q = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]  # joint positions
ee_pos = pin.get_link_position(robot, q, "end_effector")

# Compute Jacobian
J = pin.compute_geometric_jacobian(robot, q, "end_effector")

# Compute inverse dynamics (joint torques)
qd = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]  # joint velocities
qdd = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]  # joint accelerations
tau = pin.compute_inverse_dynamics(robot, q, qd, qdd)

# Compute forward dynamics (joint accelerations)
applied_torques = [1.0, 0.5, 0.2]
qdd_computed = pin.compute_forward_dynamics(robot, q, qd, applied_torques)
```
